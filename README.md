## Code Review
My challenge this time around was nesting my reaction svg inside a figure element. I did not realise that there can only be a figcaption in a figure. After messing around with it I finally reached a point where I was pleased with the result. I did this by putting the image directly in the figcaption. The outcome came out with a instagram feel to it. Exactly what I was going for. Everything else went smoothly pretty much, thanks to the past assignments with grid and flexbox.
